			Plastics are an eyesore for the oceans, animals get stuck in the bigger pieces, leading to their death. The smallest pieces are mistaken for food and therefore ingested, turtles mistake them for jellyfish, seabirds sting the floating pieces of plastic. Large cetaceans filtering seawater ingest huge amounts of plastic material. Molluscs like mussels also filter m3 of contaminated water which inexorably leads to their death<br></p>

			Why is it so important to protect our oceans ?<br>
			Oceans are essentials to the life on Earth. They product half oxygen we breathe, participate to absorb 30% CO2 mondial emissions stocked in the depth. Wihout oceans, the heat will cause humans being extinctions <br></p>

			<p class="div4_text">
			Protecting the ocean is doable, we can reduce our daily plastic consommation, consommate more ecologically, cleaning beachs...<br>
			A lot of big projects have been launched to remove plastics in the oceans like "Ocean Cleanup" who wanted to make a giant floating barrier but has never being concluant <br>
